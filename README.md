My technical skills include HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. I am currently learning Java and SQL.My hobbies include reading books, drawing, cycling, solving Sudoku and puzzles, and staying updated on emerging technologies. I contribute to open-source projects and explore artificial intelligence and machine learning.
